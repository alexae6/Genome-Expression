# Genome-Expression
*Final project for Biochemistry Course, Purdue University 2021*

The aim of this project is to build a user friendly and intuitve app to display information on the amount of PRMT and WDR77 genes expressed in different genes to better understand the relationship between different gene expressions.

In the app there are multiple different tabs:
1. RNAseq Data Tab- allows user to select a gene by typing or using a drop down menu. Displays a bar plot showing gene expression amount and providing a table of detailed gene expression
2. Gene Ontology Data Tab- allows user to select a gene by typing or using a drop down menu. Uses a slider to say how many genes to display in bar graph displaying gene expression amount- Sorted in ascending order
3. Heatmap Tab- Allows user to select the gene and different clustering parameters to create and displays a heatmap linking gene similarity
